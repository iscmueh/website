bio: "Professor Rob Cuyvers was an urban planner in the City of Mechelen, Belgium and a senior advisor for private companies and the Flemish government. He successfully managed large, complex urban projects in a regional or urban context. He was responsible for teams and budgets, and for formulating objectives and achieving goals (e.g. Lamot-site Mechelen, Park Spoor Noord Antwerp, Spatial Structure Plan Antwerp). He built up experience with participation processes and co-creation involving different actors, such as inhabitants, economic actors, planners, social actors and policy makers.
He was Director of the research group Mobility and Environment of the University College PHL and Head of the department of Architecture, Interior Architecture and Arts at the University College PHL. He was Dean of the Faculty of Architecture and arts at Hasselt University, and promoter of different international and community projects. He was member of the jury of a lot of awards, competitions and selections (e.g. for the Flemish Governmental Architect)."
