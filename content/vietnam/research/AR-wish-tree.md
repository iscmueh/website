ISCM-UEH collaborates with VNUHCM â€“ University of Science, ABB Research (Sweden), and Zeta Motion Co. to explore augmented reality (AR) to design a digitally enhanced tree of wishes. It combines an art installation (e.g., a sculpture) serving as the physical proxy of the tree and digital enhancements viewed through a mobile AR application. This solution allows people to creatively express their thoughts and richly interact with them and mitigate the problems of traditional physical trees. The tree can act as an attraction for a location or a venue.
