ISCM-UEH is developing a smart traffic safety education program that engages the participation of students, teachers, and parents. The program includes three packages of R2S Education, R2S Map, and Expected VR Game. It provides a flexible teaching method for distance learning and effective measurement and verification of changes in attitude, action, habit, and behavior in traffic participation. The program is expected to scale up to different geographic regions, social-economic characteristics, different regulations, and elective courses.
