descriptionn: "The Thanh Da peninsula in Ho Chi Minh City faces significant challenges. The combination of climate change, flooding, urbanization, and the loss of green space threatens the livability of the area. Our multidisciplinary team proudly introduces the
“Waterwoven Grid” project, an innovative master plan that integrates Dutch water
management principles with Vietnamese culture. This plan offers a future-proof and
holistic design that combines ecological sustainability, urban development, and cultural identity. Thanh Da is grappling with severe flooding issues due to heavy rainfall,
rising sea levels, and inadequate infrastructure. Urbanization has reduced natural
water absorption and fragmented green spaces. At the same time, there is a shortage of affordable housing and modern amenities for residents. This master plan provides solutions by combining water management with the redevelopment of urban and
natural spaces. <br /> <br />
The meso area vision encompasses the entire Thanh Da peninsula. Here, the Dutch
approach of “room for the river” is applied by designing flood zones along the edges
of the peninsula. These wetlands serve as natural buffers against rising water, while
dikes, sluices, and ‘groynes’ provide protection against erosion. By strategically designating areas for urban, agricultural, and natural functions, ecological balance is
restored. The grid structure enhances connectivity between residential areas, agricultural land, and nature while preserving the existing qualities of Thanh Da. <br /> <br />
The micro area focuses on a specific neighborhood and illustrates how it can be
redeveloped. Flood-prone areas are transformed into functional floodplains with
raised walkways that provide access to nature and recreation. Residential areas are
densified through infill development and the addition of new superblocks inspired
by traditional Vietnamese architecture. Public amenities such as schools, parks, and
healthcare facilities are expanded to support the growing population. The micro area
not only offers protection against water but also creates a livable, sustainable, and
inclusive urban environment. Islands have been introduced to protect the peninsula
from erosion. <br /> <br />
The restaurant serves as the heart of the boulevard and is a unique meeting place
for residents and tourists. Inspired by floating architecture, it adapts to changing
water levels. The restaurant features local dishes with stalls run by residents, as well
as recreational activities such as paddle-pong. Through its integration with the boulevard—functioning as a multifunctional dike and public space—the restaurant fosters
social cohesion and economic growth. <br /> <br />
The vacation homes in the floodplains provide visitors with a unique experience of
the Vietnamese landscape. Designed according to traditional Mekong Delta architecture, these houses vary in size and are built on elevated platforms to withstand flooding. The natural environment remains intact while visitors can enjoy a harmonious
interaction with water and nature. These homes combine ecotourism with cultural
heritage, making them both attractive and sustainable"
