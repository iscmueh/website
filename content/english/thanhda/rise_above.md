descriptionn: The Rise Above project is an innovative urban redevelopment proposal for Thanh Da Peninsula, a low-lying area in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. The site faces severe flood risks due to rapid urbanization, climate change, and land subsidence. Current development plans propose raising the land by several meters and replacing the existing community with high-rise buildings. However, our approach offers an alternative, sustainable design, preserving the local cultural identity and using water as leverage instead of a threat.
