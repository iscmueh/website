descriptionn: "For the new urban development of the Thanh Da Peninsula, new housing opportunities are created, while still preserving the current local heritage on the island. Existing housing typologies will be interwoven with 2 newly developed architectural typologies. <br /><br />
New sport, healthcare and recreation facilities are added on a micro scale to add more facilities to this part of the Thanh Da peninsula. More facilities and farms will be added, but the micro area will still keep its green character to attract people from the whole city and to make it a pleasant place to live. The farms still have its place and the sidewalks will still be able to be used by the street vendors. This to maintain one of the main cultural elements of Vietnam  <br /><br />
The overall accessibility of the Peninsula has drastically improved. The main road will be upgraded completely and in the south of the peninsula another connection with the main land will be created. The roads with dead ends will be connected and in this way in case of an emergency the island will be better accessible.<br /><br />
<b>Saigon's serenity complexes</b><br />
Located next to the shore of the Saigon river, the Saigon's serenity complexes offer an escape from the city's fast-paced energy, while being just moments away from the vibrant pulse of urban life. Inspired by modernist Vietnamese architecture, the facade maximalises the regulation of sunlight and improves the natural ventilation due to the concept of brise soleil. A balanced flow of energy in the buildings’ layout is created, by blending the indoor and outdoor spaces seamlessly. <br /><br />
A great design feature is the presence of communal courtyards and gardens. These open spaces serve multiple purposes like providing natural ventilation and blocking direct sunlight all while being directly connected to nature. The courtyards also act as communal spaces, where social interactions between the different households is stimulated and communities are formed.<br /><br />

<b>Thanh Thúy houses</b><br />

Inspired by Mekong Delta stilt houses, The Thanh Thuy Houses combine traditional Vietnamese elements with modern solutions. Built on stilts to adapt to wetland environments, the design ensures protection from flooding while maintaining practicality.<br /><br />
A central green corridor links the living spaces, bringing in natural light and ventilation, while terracotta bricks and tiles add durability and a cultural connection. Thanh Thuy Homes are a resilient and thoughtful solution for sustainable urban wetland living."
