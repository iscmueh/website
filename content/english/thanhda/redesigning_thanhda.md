descriptionn: "This proposal combines previous concepts with new ideas to create a comprehensive urban development plan for Thanh Da Peninsula. At its core is a spider web-like grid serving as the main transportation axis, enhancing connectivity with Ho Chi Minh City. The plan retains the government’s vision of a green oasis for water retention, integrating high-density urban development while preserving and expanding greenery. Major green structures manage water through retention and gradual drainage, with a central park featuring a water filtration system. <br /><br/>
The proposal addresses socio-economic integration to prevent gentrification, using mixed-use transition zones along the grid to blend demographics and foster a vibrant, 24-hour environment. The Central Business District (CBD) at the peninsula's core will house businesses, offices, hospitals, schools, and universities, concentrating the highest density there. <br /><br/>
The redevelopment respects Thanh Da’s rural character, introducing new high-density developments alongside ecological preservation. Key infrastructure includes three bridges to improve connectivity, a continuous recreational waterfront pathway, and a mangrove forest for flood protection and carbon capture. The central heritage village preserves cultural identity through traditional activities, supporting community engagement.<br /><br/>
A large wetland park in the south aids flood management while enhancing ecological value. The food court and integrated food market feature sustainable design with greenery walls and bio-based materials, fostering community and boosting the local economy through locally sourced produce and diverse culinary experiences.<br /><br/>
The architectural design for the Green-Blue Oasis, addresses Ho Chi Minh City’s unique challenges. This multifunctional core collects rainwater, supports vertical circulation, and creates green meeting spaces, aligning with the city's tropical climate and social dynamics. Floating piers adjust to water levels, ensuring functional harbors, while galleries offer multifunctional spaces for gathering and working.<br /><br/>
Though the design achieves most goals, further exploration of biobased insulation and facade materials could enhance sustainability in Ho Chi Minh City's tropical environment. This project aims to showcase architecture’s role in fostering a sustainable, connected future, refined to the city's unique character.<br /><br/>
The food court with an integrated food market at Thanh Da Peninsula offers a vibrant blend of culture and economic growth. Its design, featuring lush greenery walls and bio-based glulam, promotes sustainability while creating a modern, eco-friendly atmosphere. This space serves as a hub for students, local farmers, and residents, fostering a sense of community. The food market provides fresh, locally sourced produce, benefiting nearby farmers, while the food court offers diverse culinary experiences. Its sustainable design enhances the neighbourhood’s aesthetic and environmental quality, attracting both locals and visitors, boosting the local economy, and creating a vibrant social space."
