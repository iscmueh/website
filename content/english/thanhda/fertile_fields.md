descriptionn: "Thanh Da Peninsula, located in the heart of Ho Chi Minh City and surrounded by the Saigon
River, faces complex challenges due to climate change and urbanisation. The region faces
regular floods, salinisation of agricultural land and a housing shortage. These problems
threaten the livability and economic stability of the area. To address these challenges, an
innovative redevelopment project has been set up with a focus on water management,
sustainable architecture and urban agriculture"
