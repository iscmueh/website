descriptionn: "The Thanh Da peninsula in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, faces critical challenges posed by
rapid urbanization, rising sea levels, and inadequate water management systems. Situated
along the Saigon River, this low-lying area is highly vulnerable to flooding, compounded by
land subsidence and the loss of natural wetlands to infrastructure development.
Traditionally, water has been treated as a force to resist a threat to the urban fabric. However,
the FloodSmart Thanh Da project seeks to transform this perception, introducing a paradigm
shift where water is embraced as an opportunity to create a resilient, sustainable, and
thriving urban environment. <br /><br/>
The project envisions Thanh Da as a model for flood-resilient urban design, integrating
innovative solutions at both the meso and micro scales to address its unique challenges.
The meso scale focuses on broader strategies for flood resilience and ecological restoration,
while the micro scale demonstrates how these principles can be applied to smaller,
community-focused areas. Together, these scales form a cohesive framework that
transforms the peninsula into a thriving ecosystem that coexists with water. <br /><br/>
At the meso scale, the project emphasizes the division of the peninsula into two distinct
zones: the hard wetland and the soft wetland, each tailored to its topographic and ecological
conditions. The hard wetland, located in the western, urbanized part of the peninsula,
focuses on integrating flood resilience into a dense, developed environment. Nature-based
solutions such as permeable pavements, bioswales, and green roofs are implemented to
manage stormwater and reduce surface runoff. Public spaces like water squares and
floodable parks serve dual purposes, acting as recreational spaces during dry seasons and
retention basins during floods. Elevated roads and stilted housing ensure the safety of
residents while preserving the permeability of the land below. <br /><br/>
In contrast, the soft wetland, located in the lower-lying eastern part of the peninsula,
prioritizes ecological restoration and natural flood management. This area embraces its
vulnerability to flooding, leveraging it to create a dynamic, water-centered landscape.
Restored floodplains absorb excess water during heavy rains, reducing the risk of flooding in
urban zones. Mangrove forests are reintroduced along riverbanks, acting as natural barriers
against storm surges and erosion while improving biodiversity. These mangroves not only
protect the shoreline but also provide habitats for wildlife and enhance water quality.
Seasonal flooding is utilized for flood-based agriculture, enabling the cultivation of rice andwater spinach, which thrive in wet conditions. This strategy supports food security and
creates economic opportunities for local farmers. <br /><br/>
At the micro scale, the project applies these principles to a specific area along a natural
waterway, showcasing how urban and natural systems can coexist at a community level.
This site features a combination of flood-resilient housing, multifunctional public spaces,
and productive agricultural zones. Housing is elevated on stilts, a design inspired by
traditional Vietnamese architecture, protecting residents from floodwaters while allowing
the land below to absorb and manage water. Between housing clusters, bioswales and green
corridors manage stormwater, creating shaded pathways that connect residents to public
spaces and natural areas. <br /><br/>
Public spaces in the micro area are designed to be flexible and multifunctional. For example,
a central water square acts as a community gathering place during dry seasons and as a
retention basin during floods. Similarly, floodable parks and gardens provide recreational
opportunities while managing excess water during heavy rains. These spaces foster social
interaction and community resilience, transforming water from a threat into a resource that
enriches daily life. <br /><br/>
Flood-based agriculture is also a key feature of the micro area. Seasonal ponds support
aquaculture and irrigation, while flood-tolerant crops are cultivated in designated zones.
This approach not only turns flooding into a productive force but also preserves the cultural
heritage of agricultural practices in Thanh Da. By blending agriculture with urban
development, the micro area creates a sustainable model that enhances food security and
ecological health. <br /><br/>
Connectivity is a central focus of both the meso and micro scale designs. The peninsula’s
reliance on a single access road and ferry is addressed through the introduction of new ferry
routes, elevated walkways, and pedestrian-friendly streets. At the meso scale, these new
transport networks link Thanh Da to Ho Chi Minh City’s urban core, enhancing accessibility
and reducing isolation. At the micro scale, internal pathways connect residential areas with
public spaces and agricultural zones, fostering a cohesive and integrated community.
The FloodSmart Thanh Da project places a strong emphasis on cultural sensitivity and
community engagement. At both scales, the design respects traditional ways of life while
introducing modern solutions that empower residents to shape their environment. Flexible
public spaces accommodate cultural festivals, markets, and gatherings, fostering a sense
of ownership and pride among the community. <br /><br/>
By addressing both the large-scale challenges of flooding and the smaller-scale needs of
communities, the FloodSmart Thanh Da project creates a harmonious balance betweenresilience, sustainability, and livability. At the meso scale, it restores the peninsula’s natural
capacity to manage water while enhancing connectivity and infrastructure. At the micro
scale, it transforms vulnerable areas into vibrant, adaptive spaces that enrich the lives of
residents. Together, these approaches demonstrate a profound paradigm shift in urban
design, turning water from a threat into a resource. Thanh Da stands as a global example of
how flood-prone areas can embrace water to create sustainable, thriving communities."
