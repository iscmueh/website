descriptionn: "Between 1980 and 2006, areas like Thảo Điền and Hiệp Bình Chánh thrived, but the Thanh Da peninsula lagged due to limited traffic access, subsidence, and costly flood protection. Development is hindered by poor road connectivity and extensive water management needs due to the surrounding Saigon River. While some urbanization has occurred in the west, most of Thanh Da remains undeveloped, preserving a vital green space in the city. Since 1992, urbanization plans for Thanh Da have been proposed but not approved. These plans often prioritize profit over sustainability, threatening to eliminate the city's last major green area and harm its quality of life. <br /><br />
The task for Project Team 1 is to create a sustainable plan that improves the area while maintaining its character under the theme ‘Hybrid Gardens’. This approach aims to blend urban life with nature to create a warm and inviting environment that promotes coexistence. A detailed micro-area design will reflect the island's potential for harmonious development. <br /><br />
We achieve this by creating a new road system based on the existing and old structure. With this measure, we create a more unified community better connected to the rest of Ho Chi Minh City, the traffic plan does take into account the desire for Thanh Da not to become an extension of the city centre. <br /><br />
Thanh Da is home to a unique garden structure that stands out in Ho Chi Minh City. Our plan focuses on preserving this distinctive feature while enhancing it where possible, ensuring the peninsula's identity remains strong and adaptable for the future. <br /><br />
At the heart of our plan is the improvement of Thanh Da’s gardens. By identifying the different types of gardens, we developed specific strategies for each one. For instance, the common pond gardens are transformed into lively community spaces, encouraging social connections and adding more value to the area. <br /><br />
To address flooding and water management, we propose using a polder system. This solution protects the land from floods while causing minimal disruption to the environment, ensuring the peninsula remains safe during emergencies. <br /><br />
In terms of architecture, we respected the existing area by designing buildings that blend seamlessly with the environment, rather than demolishing existing structures. The goal is to add housing to accommodate a growing population while preserving the local character and cultural identity of Thanh Da. Architects have designed spaces that are efficient and community-focused, allowing residents to live together harmoniously while maintaining their privacy. <br /><br />
Our plan for Thanh Da seamlessly blends nature, culture, and modern living to create a sustainable and vibrant community. It proposes a way to more than double the population while preserving the peninsula’s natural character, ensuring that quality of life is enhanced without sacrificing the vital green spaces that define the area."
