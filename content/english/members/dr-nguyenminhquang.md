bio: "Nguyá»…n Minh Quang is a researcher, architect, and urban designer. Before that, Quang was trained as an urban designer and obtained M.Sc. degrees in sustainable architecture and human settlements and obtained his Ph.D. in architecture at KU Leuven, Belgium. His research focuses on forest and water urbanism in which he discovers the power of forest and water landscapes to structure urbanism. Furthermore, he and collaborators endeavor to express their ideas of a new settlement paradigm that reengages to landscape in the context of the ever-urbanized world and global warming through making proposals, design research commissions and competitions in Vietnam and Belgium. His method of working as an urban designer always begins with reading and interpretations of both historical and morphological, of the terrain through layers in which he seeks to strengthen the urban and ecological systems."
