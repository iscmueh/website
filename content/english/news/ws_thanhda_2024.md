_From March 18th to April 3rd, 2024, students of Architectural and Urban Design inclusive Smart City Bachelor Program embarked on an exhilarating experiential journey as they directly analyzed and proposed ideas for the Thanh Da Peninsula at the Workshop: Thanh Da - The Hidden Urban Oasis._

Thanh Da is gradually becoming a rare green oasis in Ho Chi Minh City. Encompassing nearly 427 hectares, this unique area is adorned with lush greenery, interspersed with natural vegetation such as meadows, ecological gardens, and captivating lotus ponds. The challenge posed to the students demanded boldness in preserving these green spaces while fostering biodiversity to transform Thanh Da into a sprawling central park for the city.

The workshop, led by esteemed guests and experts, including Professor Kelly Shannon (Director of the MaHS and MaULP Programs - International Center of Urbanism, KU Leuven, Belgium), Professor Bruno De Meulder (Vice Dean of the Faculty of Architecture - KU Leuven, Belgium), M.Arch Tran Thi Quynh Mai (Director of the Architectural and Urban Design inclusive Smart City Bachelor Program - Institute of Smart City and Management), Dr. Hoang Ngoc Lan (Senior Lecturer, Institute of Smart City and Management), Ms. Sandhya Rao, Mr. Hoang Le Nam Hai (Lecturers, Institute of Smart City and Management), and Mr. Le Quoc Viet (Specialist, Lecturer, Institute of Smart City and Management).

By providing a direct opportunity to study the Thanh Da area, the Institute of Smart City and Management - Ho Chi Minh City University of Economics, in collaboration with KU Leuven, organized the Thanh Da Workshop: The Hidden Urban Oasis. The workshop aimed to enhance students' analytical skills and creative thinking through various methods such as terrain analysis using models, landscape studies, water and green space analysis through painting, and exploration of public architectural spaces using Nolli Maps. Additionally, students dedicated time to conduct on-site surveys, ensuring that proposed solutions align with the existing potential of the peninsula.

Moreover, the Thanh Da Workshop: The Hidden Urban Oasis served as a journey to unite lecturers, specialists, and generations of learners. Through mutual exploration and overcoming challenges in embracing novel visualization methods, participants engaged in collaborative work and discussions. It was a profoundly meaningful journey where pioneers guided and supported newcomers, and subsequent cohorts learned from their predecessors. Notably, proposed solutions were reviewed by experts and invited guests from K59 Atelier and the Ho Chi Minh City Urban Development Planning Institute, fostering a collaborative and innovative spirit to shape Thanh Da into an ecological sanctuary and a resilient urban center amidst future uncertainties.
