Whether it is the beginning of the week or the weekend, day or night, our students - the first generation of Bachelor Of Architectural And Urban Design Inclusive Smart City are still tediously completing Architectural Studiolab 1  day and night.

We have been striving to create an environment where learners unleash their creativity and development under the guidance of the passionate and dedicated ISCM team, where learning and collaboration will be the driving force for each student to achieve common growth.

Through ISCM, let's look back at some of the "non-prescriptive" moments of ISCM-ers. Any rain that doesn't cease, the deadline will pass. Good luck to all students who are about to complete this project!
