Recently, experts and professors from the Institute of Smart City and Management at UEH (UEH ISCM) presented at two sessions during the **8th Annual Conference of the International Place Branding Association (IPBA)**, held in Bangkok, Thailand. Their presentation, titled “Towards A Comprehensive Integrated City Branding Framework: View From City Marketer and City Planner”, earned them the prestigious **“Best Paper” Award**.

The research introduces a novel theoretical framework that integrates the perspectives of urban planners and city marketers. It argues that city branding should not be viewed solely as the responsibility of either urban planners or marketers. Instead, an interdisciplinary, cross-sectoral integrated framework is required. This approach emphasizes urban identity as the central theme, addressing emerging urban challenges throughout the city development process, ultimately aiming to enhance residents' quality of life.
