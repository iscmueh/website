_At the end of July 2024, the Institute of Smart City and Management, in collaboration with Handong Global University (Korea), Ngurah Rai University (Indonesia), KU Leuven University (Belgium), and the University of Trieste (Italy), organized the International Summer Camp "Urban Beyond the Urban 2024" in Cam Lam - Khanh Hoa. This year's summer camp is themed “Smart Approaches: Co-Creation Foundation and Nature-Based Solutions for Cam Lam, Khanh Hoa”._

Where skyscrapers now stand, few people know that it was once an area of sand dunes combined with shrubs, stretching along a naturally formed lagoon. An area that once had pristine natural landscapes is now filled with concrete structures, with white regions covering the green ones. This is the visible future of an urban area whose development process does not rely on the natural characteristics it possesses.

Following the success of the previous year, the International Summer Camp "Urban Beyond the Urban 2024" (UBU 2024) has arrived in Cam Lam - Khanh Hoa. The program is themed “Smart Approaches: Co-Creation Foundation and Nature-Based Solutions for Cam Lam, Khanh Hoa”, officially open the opportunities for students to embark on a journey to find solutions to preserve the existing green spaces and expand them. The camp has attracted the attention and participation of 30 students from Vietnam, Korea, and Indonesia

**Hills, sand, and beaches - Cam Lam and ideas for urbanization without leaving anything behind**

“Cam Lam is a very beautiful and pristine suburb. However, looking at maps starting from the 1960s, it is easy to see the gradual loss of the original green areas along Bai Dai Beach. Instead, tourist areas and resorts have turned these areas into patches of white and gray sand and buildings.”

Through on-site observations, interviews with local residents, and consultations from local departments, student groups have summarized the current situation of Cam Lam and proposed nature-based solutions that still meet the living needs of the local people. These ideas are not only the result of diligent work by nearly 30 students from 3 countries but also of dedicated exchanges and sharing between students and experts in the field.

Group 1 focused on enhancing access to the beach areas. Solutions were proposed to "return the beach area to all communities" with three types of designs: transformation, combination, and conservation. These designs will be applied depending on the existing residential structure and spatial potential to enhance access to public water spaces, address urban issues, maintain connectivity, and improve the quality of life.

With an extremely diverse ecology stretching from the west to the east of the tidal lagoon, group 2 of the UBU summer camp discovered the hidden laws of nature, especially the connection between nature and socio-economic activities. From there, the proposed idea emphasizes urban development while preserving the natural features, especially the sand dunes and naturally formed water lenses.

Group 3 concluded the necessity of sustainable fishing activities, pollution control, and proactive conservation efforts. The group pointed out that community-engaging activities and enforcement of environmental regulations can help preserve the Tidal Lagoon for future generations.

Group 4 brought a development strategy tailored to the characteristics of Cam Duc. Through studies, the group concluded that connectivity between regional segments is crucial for a healthy ecosystem. Fragmented patterns of people/buildings, topography, water, and vegetation can be restored by new solutions, cutting, and replacing exotic species with native ones.

Group 5 aimed to restructure the region and the lives of Cam Ranh residents. The group proposed expanding pedestrian areas across the Tidal Lagoon to enhance economic connectivity. The existing vacant space in the area would become a residential and traditional tourist zone. Moreover, the residential area is proposed to begin implementing environmental protection policies, especially placing waste sorting areas in residential zones, particularly in front of primary schools to initially educate local people's environmental awareness.

**Connecting young people from different disciplines, countries, and personalities**

An indispensable part of the International Summer Camp "Urban Beyond the Urban 2024", students from Vietnam, Korea, and Indonesia spent time experiencing the pristine beauty of Cam Lam in particular and Khanh Hoa in general. In just 3 working days, young people participated in beach activities, studied and researched nature-based solutions, and more importantly, engaged in cultural exchanges between countries.

And above all, with expertise ranging from architecture, urban design, urban planning to data science, business administration, and communication-design, the Summer Camp provided students with a multidisciplinary, international, and diverse environment. With this unique combination, the solutions proposed have a multi-dimensional perspective on Cam Lam, especially its regional ecology.

Concluding the July summer at ISCM, the International Summer Camp "Urban Beyond the Urban" in Cam Lam - Khanh Hoa has left many marks on the journey of knowledge connection among students from many countries around the world. We believe that, along with the observations, discoveries, and learning throughout the trip, you have gained a better understanding of one of the important factors for a smart and sustainable city. More importantly, the connections you have made during the trip with Cam Lam, nature, and new friends will be meaningful assets for the journey of turning an urban area beyond the scope of a rapidly developing city into a sustainably developing urban area.
