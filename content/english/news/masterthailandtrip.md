With the objective of gaining practical experience and acquiring knowledge in the construction and development of smart and sustainable urban areas from the Bangkok government, the students had the opportunity to visit key locations such as the Bangkok City Hall - the working headquarters of the Bangkok Metropolitan Administration, the Traffic Control and Command Center under the Bangkok Traffic and Transportation Department, and the Bangkok Metropolitan Electricity Authority. During these visits, the students attentively listened to insights regarding the formation and development of smart cities, urban planning, and the process of constructing and developing sustainable smart cities in Bangkok, Thailand.

In order to enhance the quality of life for citizens, the Bangkok government consistently emphasizes the importance of gathering opinions and mobilizing citizen participation in activities, utilizing technology as a tool to address existing urban issues, sharing data, managing energy usage, and reducing emissions.

During the study tour, the students also had the opportunity to explore Klong Ong-Ang pedestrian street, the first public park on the Chao Phraya River named Chao Phraya Sky Park, and other significant infrastructure projects. ISCM believes that, alongside the information gathered and practical experiences gained, the students have obtained a more comprehensive perspective on the application of technology, urban planning, and management of the city of Bangkok. This, in turn, allows them to understand and adjust solutions to align with the specific characteristics of the localities in which they are employed.
