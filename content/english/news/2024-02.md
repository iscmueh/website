ðŸ¥°Last Sunday, on March 3, 2024, the Institute of Smart City and Management - the University of Economics Ho Chi Minh City (UEH) had the opportunity to meet directly with parents and students from various provinces and cities at the Career Guidance & Admissions day 2024. This annual event was hosted at the University of Technology (Vietnam National University Ho Chi Minh City) with the aim of assisting future generations in gaining a better understanding of over 100 universities and colleges.

From course project booklets to unique 3D printing models, the consultation area of the Architectural and Urban Design Inclusive Smart City (BAUD) Bachelor program gained significant attention from students interested in exploring architectural design and urban planning, particularly those who were keen on understanding the applications of technology throughout their academic journey. Alongside direct guidance from BAUD program students, attendees, including parents and students, gained authentic insights into the dynamic and creative life at ISCM (#LifeAtISCM).

ðŸŒ±ISCM extends sincere gratitude to high school teachers, esteemed parents, and students for your interest, engagement, and discussions regarding the field of Architectural and Urban Design Inclusive Smart City (ISCM). We aspire to be your companions on the #shapingtheunknownfuture journey, contributing positively to the community.
