🎉 On April 1st, 2023, the Institute of Smart City and Management (ISCM) in collaboration with the Department of Student Affairs (DSA), UEH Smart Library successfully organized the program Demo Class: “From Dream to Life - Bachelor of Architectural and Urban Design Inclusive Smart City Program”.


😺 Through a series of activities such as Campus Tour, Demo Class, and discovering ISCM's life (#LifeatISCM) from participating in international research projects to join in activities from ISCM Club, exhibitions to exciting technology experiences, the ISCM team believes that the Demo Class has opened up the most comprehensive view of the curriculum of architecture, design, planning, urban development fields, especially of the Bachelor of Architectural and Urban Design Inclusive Smart City Program. From there, students will have the motivation to nurture their dreams and open up diverse and realistic perspectives when choosing ISCM, UEH as a companion for upcoming journeys.
