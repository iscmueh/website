Art is the path to the creative power within each child and “every child is an artist” (Pablo Picasso). To this end, Workshop Art Summer Camp for Kids was created and designed specifically for children (from 5 to 15 years old) with the desire to nurture the potential of children by stimulating the potential creative power of art within each child.

Workshop Art Summer Camp For Kids is a program in the event series with the theme A Future Resilience through Smart City Lens of UEH under the chairmanship of ISCM. This event series is with the desire to create many educational activities, support the community, enhance interactivity and connection, and contribute to building and spreading positively of the multidisciplinary & sustainable UEH University.

Let’s look back on this event with us!
