Accompanying with 10 students from the Singapore University of Technology and Design, students from the UEH actively participated in learning and expanding their knowledge of applying new technologies, especially AI, to address urban issues in various aspects. This was achieved through insights shared by professors and experts in the field. Additionally, emphasizing the combination of theory and practice, the course was designed with field trips for students to gather information and process data.

A highlight of the course was the objective to complete a scientific research paper according to standard criteria. Student groups, comprising both SUTD and UEH students, conducted on-site visits, collected and processed data, and discussed problem-solving under the guidance of faculty members from both institutions. Following this hands-on experience, participants will continue collaborating online to finalize their research on the chosen topics.
