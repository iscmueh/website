Challenging yet full of opportunities, the ever-changing world forces us to continuously explore, research, adapt, and evolve. The fusion of civilizations and knowledge, or globalization, offers us the chance to "think globally, act locally." This means being ready to absorb the world's finest knowledge and effectively apply it to local issues. This approach is evident in many fields, including architectural and urban design.

Embracing this spirit, on July 6, 2024, the Institute of Smart City and Management, in collaboration with its partners hosted the seminar with the participation of young Vietnamese architects who have studied and worked abroad. The discussions focused on the challenges and difficulties of effectively applying international solutions in the Vietnamese architectural environment.
