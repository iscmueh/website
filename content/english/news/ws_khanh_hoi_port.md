*The workshop titled "What Constitutes a Successful Feasibility Study for the Renovation of Saigon’s Old Port - Cang Khanh Hoi?" was jointly organized by the Institute of Smart City and Management (ISCM) - the University of Economics Ho Chi Minh City (UEH), the French organization ADEME (the Ministry of Ecological Transition and Territorial Cohesion), and Terao Asia (Singapore) on September 19, 2024, at UEH’s Campus B.*

The Khanh Hoi Port renovation project aims to meet the city's development needs and direction in terms of the environment, commerce, tourism heritage, and port activities. It is also one of six objectives outlined in the Memorandum of Understanding signed between the Ho Chi Minh City Department of Planning and Architecture and ADEME. In this regard, the People’s Committee of Ho Chi Minh City has committed to redeveloping Khanh Hoi Port as part of the strategic development plans for the Saigon River corridor.

The workshop saw the participation of representatives from the French Consulate General in Ho Chi Minh City, the Ho Chi Minh City Department of Planning and Architecture, Saigon Port Authority, various specialized departments of Ho Chi Minh City, universities, and private companies in Vietnam, with the goal of sharing, discussing, and evaluating factors related to port development through presentations and analyses of infrastructure, environmental, socio-economic, financial, and policy aspects concerning port area planning and development.
