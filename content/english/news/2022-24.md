This is a photo of our very first students of the Executive Master of Smart City and Innovation Management programs, who were studying Data Analysis & Data Mining in the Studiolab. At ISCM, we encourage the mindset of  not only actively studying but also supporting each others (which can be seen clearly through this photo). We always welcome these, since they are the future Executive managers in public sector, especially in the area of urban, smart city planning as well as the one who positively influence the society.

It is also worth noting down that ISCM team proudly have Studiolab rooms, where morden technology experience, Smart City Simulation and integrated application to solve the society’s problems is provided. This is also where many universites, governmental management offices, research organizations becomes partners to solve issues’ related to Smart Cit ad Sustainable Future.

Especially, there is also an appearance of an ISCM team members who study Master at Seoul National Universities (SNU). He just come back and is now a tutor for this subject.
