## _Aim to propose models, measurement indicators, as well as specific solutions to develop core digital economic sectors in Ho Chi Minh City, the **Department of Information and Communications HCMC** has led research projects on Digital Economy in 2024. The project has the participation of **the Institute of Smart City and Management (ISCM)** and **the Institute of Regional Research and Development Consulting** at the **University of Economics Ho Chi Minh City**._

According to Resolution 31/2022 issued by the Politburo, Ho Chi Minh City has been assigned to become the national leader in the digital economy transformation by 2030. Leveraging the favorable environment and the promising outlook for a vibrant digital economy market in Asia, Ho Chi Minh City needs to develop practical insights into both the national and city-specific digital economy landscape. This involves applying appropriate models and measurement indices to achieve the set goals.

Recognizing this need, the **Department of Information and Communications of Ho Chi Minh City** is leading the project to propose specific solutions for advancing the digital economy in the city. This effort includes collaboration with **the Institute of Smart City and Management and the Institute of Regional Research and Development Consulting** at the **University of Economics Ho Chi Minh City**. Additionally, the project benefits from the advisory input of prominent experts such as Associate Professor Giuseppe Borruso (University of Trieste, Italy), Associate Professor Jinhyun Hong (Seoul National University, South Korea), Dr. Chinh Ho (University of Sydney, Australia), Professor Sung Jin Khang (Korea University), and Dr. Julia Babcock (Portland State University, USA).

**Challenges to Overcome in Developing the Digital Economy in Ho Chi Minh City**

To achieve rapid and sustainable development in the digital economy, Ho Chi Minh City faces numerous opportunities but also significant challenges. One major challenge is the widespread dissemination of digital economy knowledge. Many foundational concepts and aspects of the digital economy are not yet fully understood or broadly communicated, which hampers the implementation of policies and adoption of digital technologies. Additionally, the lack of standardized methods and measurement tools for the digital economy diminishes the feasibility and complicates comparisons of indices and development progress. Furthermore, there is insufficient policy support and resources for small and medium-sized enterprises.

**The Research Project: Bridging University Research and Government Initiatives**

The research team from the **University of Economics Ho Chi Minh City (UEH)** and the **Department of Information and Communications of Ho Chi Minh City** is tasked with producing quarterly assessment and analysis reports. These reports are essential for rapidly updating and monitoring the progress of digital economy development, identifying issues, and proposing directions or adjustments for digital economy strategies. This approach represents the most practical solution for the swift and sustainable development of Ho Chi Minh City's digital economy.

Regular evaluation and analysis are deemed necessary for the city to track and update the progress of its digital economy over time. This ensures both the speed of development and sustainability, thereby strengthening the city's resilience against future challenges. The reports will encompass an assessment of the current state of the digital economy in Vietnam and Ho Chi Minh City, propose models and measurement indices for the digital economy, and provide specific solutions for developing core economic sectors.

Following the research phase, the team from the **University of Economics Ho Chi Minh City** will present conclusions to the city's relevant agencies, offering development strategies and affirming Ho Chi Minh City's leading role in Vietnam's digital economy. Furthermore, this research project is grounded in a co-creation framework, which serves as an auxiliary method for research. Through this approach, the research team will engage in data collection from businesses in the sector, consult with experts, and gather input from stakeholders both domestically and internationally during workshops on digital economy strategies for the region.
