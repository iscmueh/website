**_University of Economics Ho Chi Minh City (UEH) continues to affirm their position on the regional and international education map with the 136th position in the Asian University Rankings 2025 as announced by Times Higher Education (THE). This is a breakthrough milestone for UEH: officially achieving the key goal for 2025-2045._**

**136th place in Asia's Top Universities**

THE Asia Rankings 2025 evaluated more than 853 universities from 35 countries and territories, according to those criteria including: Research quality; Research environment; Teaching; R&D, Industry; International outlook.

With comprehensive and intense development, UEH has been ranked **136th in terms of the best universities in Asia 2025**, following the impressive milestone that UEH had previously achieved in THE World University Rankings 2025, with a position in the **Top 501–600 leading universities in the world**. This is the highest result among higher education institutions in Vietnam, ranked in the same evaluation period. UEH can be an option for "study abroad" in Vietnam with the training quality of a global university for high school students and students of all levels.

This achievement also helps UEH officially complete one of the key goals set for the 2025 - 2045 period: **"Being in the Top 250 leading universities in Asia by 2030 and Top 150 by 2045"**. This demonstrates the UEH collective's strong efforts and, once again, affirms the multi-disciplinary and sustainable development strategy that UEH has been implementing.

_“For nearly half a century, UEH has been very successful as a national key university, constantly increasing their ranking position in the region and the world. In the new era, UEH has been transforming strongly to become a Multidisciplinary and Sustainable University. With consensus and determination, today, UEH has reached the finish line very early, one of many key goals in the period 2025-2045: Being one of the 150 best universities in Asia. This is a great collective achievement and a launching pad for our strong transformation in the upcoming period,"_ remarked Prof. Dr. Nguyen Dong Phong, Chairman of the University Council.

With their collective internal strength, UEH has been firmly walking on the path of internationalization with the vision of becoming a leading multidisciplinary and sustainable university in Asia. UEH is committed to training global citizens and contributing knowledge to the community for a sustainable future.
