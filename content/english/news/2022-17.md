It has been several weeks since the ORIENTATION DAY for K48 - especially for freshmen from the Institute of Smart City and Management (ISCM) and the School of Media Design (SMD), occurred. However, we still can feel the youthful energy from that day.

Orientation day was not only the greetings that we, ISCM and SMD, wanted to send to our new students, but it was also our effort to create an opportunity for them to integrate into the new environment quickly. In order to do that, we organized several activities, such as an exhibition of projects from K47 - ISCM, Random Dance, a Workshop from SMD, and Talks from SMD & ISCMâ€™s lecturers.

We believe that, after the Orientation Day, K48 would get some necessary knowledge for their new journey - a journey of exploration and expression of themselves to the world.

Now, let us rewind to some precious moments from our Orientation Day!
