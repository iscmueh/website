The Circular City paradigm contains not only principles of the Circular Economy (recovery, recycling, reuse and sharing), but also the introductions of actions related to the development of renewable energy communities, use of green materials and CO2 uptake, Triple Access Planning (TAP). Seeing these aspects of the paradigm fully fit the 2030 agenda, the session “Resilient, Circular and Sustainable Cities” is held, with the aim to host the contributions from those scholars interested in analyzing such phenomena from different points of view. In addition, the attention of the session will also be driven by the role of technologies playing on such urban issues, as well as the proposal of sustainable solutions.

The session is hosted by professors and experts from many universities and organizations around the world, namely Balletto Ginevra (University of Cagliari), Ladu Mara (University of Cagliari), Trinh Tu Anh (Institute of Smart City and Management, University of Economics Ho Chi Minh), Borruso Giuseppe (University of Trieste), Fancello Gianfranco (University of Cagliari) and Balázs Kulcsár (University of Debrecen).

Session: Resilient, Circular and Sustainable Cities is a part of the 12th International Conference on Innovation in Urban and Regional Planning (INPUT 2023), held in L’Aquila (Italy) from 6-8 September, 2023.
