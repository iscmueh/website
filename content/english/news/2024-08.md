The world is facing significant challenges such as population growth, urbanization, migration to cities, and increasing environmental pressures. Addressing these issues urgently requires a reasonable solution for developing regions into smart and sustainable cities. One proposed solution is the Living Lab, which represents a real-world testing environment where the public sector, private sector, citizens, and researchers can collaborate to test, evaluate, and develop innovative solutions for urban areas and communities. It is evident that the connection among stakeholders is crucial for applying the Living Lab model to solve sustainability issues.
