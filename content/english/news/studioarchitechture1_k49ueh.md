From June 12 to June 15, 2024, Da Lat was the destination for the first field trip of the 49th cohort of students specializing in Architectural and Urban Design Inclusive Smart City Bachelor Program. This trip was an integral part of the Studiolab Architecture 1: Residential Project. The theme, "Application of Indigenous Architecture in Natural Housing Design," offered students a unique perspective of Da Lat through direct observation of local life and the study of regional architecture.

As part of an annual tradition for Architectural and Urban Design Inclusive Smart City Bachelor Program students, the K49 embarked on their field trip to Da Lat, Lam Dong Province. Supported by experts, lecturers, and students from Yersin University (Da Lat), this Field Trip for Studiolab Architecture 1: Residential Project focused on designing homes in harmony with indigenous architecture and natural surroundings. 

The trip successfully provided K49 students with a new perspective on Da Lat. Not just a top tourist destination in Vietnam, Da Lat, through the eyes of K49 students, revealed itself as an urban area reflecting various historical periods and a blend of unique indigenous architectural styles.

**Studiolab Architecture 1: Residential Project and the First Field Trip for BAUD Students**

From their first course, Studiolab Architecture 1: Residential Project has been one of the most memorable projects for students in the program. Following previous trips to Vinh Long with the K47 and Phu Yen with the K48, this year's visit to Da Lat allowed students to engage in the essential phases of a basic design project. Participants familiarized themselves with the design process, emphasizing the connection between data collection during the survey phase and the development of final design solutions.

Continuing this goal, this year's theme for Studiolab Architecture 1  was designing homes that harmonize with indigenous architecture and natural surroundings. Given Da Lat's increasingly unpredictable extreme weather and high landslide risks, the project challenged students to develop smart, innovative housing solutions that incorporate vernacular architecture.

**Seeing Da Lat Through the Lens of Architecture and Smart Urban Design**

During the 4-day field trip, 19 student groups from three K49 classes surveyed their assigned areas, assessed the region's potential, and developed a cohesive concept for the entire area. This was their first experience viewing Da Lat through the perspective of architects and urban designers. With support from lecturers and students from Yersin University, UEH-ISCM students gained valuable insights and guidance necessary for proposing design solutions aligned with the theme of  vernacular architecture in nature-based design.

With the collected information, students will continue to work on and propose design solutions meeting the project's requirements. This phase encourages them to practice sustainable design thinking, contextual appropriateness, and the ability to translate research data into suitable design solutions.

The 4-day field trip for Architectural Project 1: Housing in Da Lat is just one of many future trips for Architecture and Smart Urban Design students. These trips are essential for firsthand experience and personal development. Follow ISCM's exciting journeys on Facebook, LinkedIn, Website, and YouTube!
