By the end of 2023, the students' final presentation took place for the resilient landscape design studio of the third bachelor year at UEH University, Ho Chi Minh City. Main objective of the studio was to explore nature-based solutions (NbS) in a resilient park design to contribute to a wider blue-green network in Thu Duc City district, a large urban district near Ho Chi Minh City center, Vietnam.

This landscape design studio ran in parallel with the initial project study ‘Integrated Flood Management Thu Duc City’ initiated by the Partners for Water program of the Netherlands government in collaboration with the World Bank and executed by main consultant Royal HaskoningDHV with its partners Delta Context and OMGEVING. In parallel with the initial project, the landscape design studio aimed to create crosspollination between the academic field and the design practice for the future sustainable development of Thu Duc City district.
