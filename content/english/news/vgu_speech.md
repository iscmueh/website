<p><span style="font-family: Barlow, sans-serif">On December 19, 2024, Dr. Architect Huynh Van Khang represented the Institute of Smart City and Management (ISCM) at the <strong>Sustainable Architecture Practice Seminar</strong> held at Vietnamese-German University (VGU). During the event, Dr. Khang shared insights on <strong>Adaptive Architectural Design Practices in Vietnam</strong>, offering VGU students fresh and comprehensive perspectives on sustainable architecture. His presentation focused on architectural designs that adapt to Vietnam's climatic conditions, such as sun, wind, light, and other environmental factors.</span></p><figure class="w-100" style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center; justify-content: center;"><img src="/images/news/vgu_speech/image2.png" alt="image2.png" title="image2.png" class="w-[80%]"></figure><p style="text-align: center; margin-top: -40px"><span style="font-family: Barlow, sans-serif"><strong><em>From left to right</em></strong><em>: Prof. Rudolf Luckmann, Mr. Pham Van Giang, Ms. Tran Hong Thu, Dr. Architect Huynh Van Khang, Dr. Nguyen Dinh Hung, Prof. Michael de Saldanha, Mr. Thu Alexander Quynh, Dr. Tran Ngoc Linh, Dr. Le Thi Thu Huong</em></span></p><p><strong>ARConCIEL – VGU Architecture Day 2024</strong></p><p><span style="font-family: Barlow, sans-serif">On December 19, 2024, VGU hosted <strong>VGU Architecture Day – ARC 2024</strong> to celebrate the 5th anniversary of its Architecture program.

By comprehensively studying the surrounding environment and incorporating intelligent design solutions, these structures minimize negative environmental impacts. This approach contributes to sustainable development in the areas where such buildings are located.</span></p><figure class="w-100" style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center; justify-content: center;"><img src="/images/news/vgu_speech/image1.png" alt="image1.png" title="image1.png" class="w-[80%]"></figure><p><span style="font-family: Barlow, sans-serif">Dr. Khang emphasized that <strong>adaptive architectural design</strong>, particularly passive architecture, is the key to sustainable architecture practices in Vietnam. This conclusion stems from his extensive research and aligns with the <strong>Glocal Design</strong> pillar—one of five core research pillars currently being developed at ISCM.</span></p><figure class="w-100" style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center; justify-content: center;"><img src="/images/news/vgu_speech/image3.png" alt="image3.png" title="image3.png" class="w-[80%]"></figure>
