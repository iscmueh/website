On May 12, 2024, the 2024 Demo Class of the Architectural and Urban Design Inclusive Smart City Bachelor Program, themed "Dare to Think - Dare to Dream," officially came to a close. However, the ISCM team believes that this is merely the beginning of a journey for a community of young people who dare to think big and create a smart and sustainable life.

Organized by the Institute of Smart City and Management - University of Economics Ho Chi Minh City (UEH - ISCM), in collaboration with the UEH Department of Student Affairs (DSA) and the UEH Smart Library, the Demo Class event is one of the annual admission activities for the Architectural and Urban Design Inclusive Smart City Bachelor Program. The program aims to provide high school students with the opportunity to experience being a student at a sustainable and multidisciplinary university for a day, with real classes, modern and intelligent facilities at UEH, and a vibrant student life.

Returning in May 2024, the Demo Class Program carried the message "Dare to Think - Dare to Dream," encouraging high school students to step out of their comfort zones, dare to try, and dare to act in the process of realizing their goals. Building on the success of the 2023 Demo Class, participating students and their parents had the chance to experience UEH - ISCM student life directly through counseling activities, campus tours, and engaging experiences with VR, 3D printing, acrylic painting, and the exciting load-bearing bridge-building challenge.

Moreover, this yearâ€™s Demo Class event provided a connection opportunity between high school students aspiring to pursue fields related to Architecture, Landscape, and Urban Design with students from the 47th, 48th, and 49th cohorts of the Architectural and Urban Design Inclusive Smart City Bachelor Program. Through various activities throughout the program, participating students gained a deeper understanding of the major, and more importantly, the journey to becoming a sustainable community at UEH - ISCM. This special connection has inspired creativity, bold thinking, and big dreams in high school students, helping them on their path to a sustainable future.
