Organized biennially, the National Architecture Student Festival is an event for the architecture student community and related fields, organized by the Vietnam Architects Association. As a professional event, it encompasses competitions related to architectural and urban design, graphic design, sketching, and photography. Additionally, the program includes team-building activities, cultural performances seminars, and discussions relevant to the discipline. This year, under the theme 'Hue - Youth with Heritage', the activities aimed to promote and preserve the traditional beauty and heritage of the ancient capital of Hue.

Aligned with the goal of 'connecting heritage and urbanism towards sustainability', ISCM students actively engaged, showcasing their creative prowess and modern perspectives to the beautiful and ancient city of Hue. Moreover, the trip fostered strong bonds not only among UEH - ISCM students and the local community but also among students across different cohorts.

**Community integration with local residents**

Throughout the journey of connecting heritage and urbanism towards sustainability in Hue, the UEH students had many discoveries and experiences alongside their peers from other architectural institutions locally and internationally. Through team-building activities and cultural performances, students had the opportunity to meet and connect with each other. The 5-day journey not only provided memorable moments at the traditional student architecture festival but also offered new perspectives and knowledge through random grouping in the Fast Design categories A and B.

Moreover, during the more than 8-day journey, students from 3 cohorts of the Architecture and Urban Design Program for Smart Cities journeyed together, overcoming challenges, especially exploring over 5 special locations not only in Hue City but also in Quy Nhon and Tuy Hoa (Phu Yen). Engaging in various connectivity-oriented activities, the UEH students learned, played, and 'paved the way' together, creating the first impressions of the University of Economics Ho Chi Minh City at the traditional national architecture student festival, showcasing the vigor and forward-thinking mindset towards smart and sustainable urbanism.
