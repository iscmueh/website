üèôÔ∏è Last Monday, the Education Symposium: Smart City Development was held successfully, with the participation of professors and experts in Smart Cities, Mobility Planning, Urban Planning, together with PhD students, as well as university students from University of Seoul (Korea), University of Economics Ho Chi Minh City, University of Architecture Ho Chi Minh City, and Hasselt University (Belgium). This is part of a working and visiting event between Seoul University (Korea) and the Institute of Smart City and Management - University of Economics HCMC (UEH-ISCM).

üöô Coming to the seminar, representatives of experts broadened the viewer's perspective on smart cities, as well as technology applications, especially data technology to conduct research in the field of smart mobility and related fields. Besides, also mentioning technology, measurement systems as well as other factors to achieve sustainable development goals for urban areas, PhD students from universities had the opportunity to present on their projects, which are in progress.

After the presentation, the participants, especially the PhD students who just shared, had the opportunity to sit down to exchange, discuss and comment on the potential research projects. We believe that this is a valuable opportunity for not only the project owner, but also the students and participants to have a deeper understanding of the shared issue, thereby deepening research and application, towards the goal of successfully constructing a Smart City, ready to cope with unpredictable changes in the future.

üëâNow, let's look back at ISCM with memorable images recorded in our recent Education Symposium: Smart City Development.
