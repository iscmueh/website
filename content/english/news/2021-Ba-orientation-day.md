In our dreams, between virtual and real, there is always a significant gap. Just dreaming is not enough. Dreaming right is always a question we often wonder about. If now, you, the K47 generation of Urban architecture students, are still wondering about your dream, why not join the Orientation Day to better understand your choice?

The program is organized by ISCM CLUB to provide a playground and connect new K47 students majoring in Urban Architecture in particular and UEH students in general.
