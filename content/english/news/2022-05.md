In addition to studying in modern Studiolab, ISCM always strives to provide learners with the most practical experience to understand the industry and provide learners with multi-dimensional perspectives and ways of thinking, which encourages learners to continuously expand the framework of creativity, thinking, and vision. Therefore, in the subject Architecture Project 1, the ISCM team, in collaboration with UEH Vinh Long Branch, planned and organized this subject at Vinh Long city.

Here, students will take part in tours and surveys to understand the architecture and culture of the Mekong Delta, especially the entire southern region, over the years. Apply their knowledge and creativity to solve local community issues through the following theme: Smart Living: Smartly design local homes to improve the quality of life for all.
Students of BAUD also have the opportunity to interact and learn at UEH Vinh Long Branch, which contributes high-quality human resources to the Mekong Delta region.

Letâ€™s look forward to the latest information from this trip of ISCM students! Stay tuned!
