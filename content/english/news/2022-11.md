Public-private partnerships have been talked about t improve infrastructure and services, but they haven't been used much in developing countries. A case study in Khon Kaen, Thailand in which key business and community leaders worked to use the Government Special Purpose Vehicle (GSPV) idea to build a light rail train. This was done to take advantage of a national policy in Thailand to build "smart cities". This study shows both the pros and cons of the GSPV mode. The talk with Professor Bruce Gilley will provide suggestions and lessons that can be used in a similar developing country situations.
