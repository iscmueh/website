*On August 30, 2024, the Institute of Smart City and Management (ISCM), in collaboration with the American Institute of Architects (AIA) in Southeast Asia and other partners, hosted the AIA Manila Southeast Asia Conference with the theme to celebrate Health, Well-being, and Sustainable Design. The event, held in Vietnam, attracted attention not only from students of architecture and urban studies across universities in Ho Chi Minh City but also from seasoned professionals in the field.*

The International Conference of the American Institute of Architects (AIA) in Southeast Asia is honored to feature the participation of M.Arch. Nguyễn Khiêm (Representative of the American Institute of Architects in Vietnam), Dr. Architect Huỳnh Văn Khang (Lecturer, Institute of Smart Urban Management - University of Economics Ho Chi Minh City), Dr. Hoàng Ngọc Lan (Senior Lecturer, Institute of Smart Urban Management - University of Economics Ho Chi Minh City), along with guest experts and architects from not only Vietnam but also other Southeast Asian countries.

At the conference, M.Arch. Nguyễn Khiêm delivered a presentation introducing the American Institute of Architects (AIA), particularly focusing on its Southeast Asia chapter. With more than 63 members from over 10 countries and four national representatives, the association has successfully organized numerous activities connecting the global architectural community. These activities often revolve around contemporary topics, innovation, and sustainability in architecture and related fields. In addition, M.Arch. Nguyễn Khiêm also addressed the Architecture Student Awards 2024, with the theme Local Climatic-Based Design Elements For Innovative And Contemporary Architecture. The competition is organized by AIA Southeast Asia, and open to senior architecture students globally, specifically those in their 4th or 5th year of study.

Representing Vietnamese architects and designers at the conference, Dr. Huynh Van Khang (lecturer at the Institute of Smart City and Management) shared his research on the intersection of traditional architectural values and innovative design solutions, focusing on passive design and nature-friendly approaches. Notably, his discussion on the traditional "ba gian" house of southern Vietnam sparked a lively 15-minute discussion among designers from other tropical countries, highlighting shared climatic challenges.

Additionally, at the Vietnam location, the event was held live at Campus B of the University of Economics, Ho Chi Minh City. Attending students posed various questions, not only related to the research topic but also about the research process and the challenges Dr. Huynh Van Khang faced before reaching his conclusions. ISCM believes that Dr. Huynh Van Khang’s insights have provided students with a deeper understanding of the doctoral research journey and, more importantly, have inspired them to pursue research that contributes to the sustainable development of regions, cities, and communities.
