**Today, the sustainable university model plays an important role in developing countries; in contrast, many difficulties in the implementation phase are available due to the limited autonomy and specific social factors. This research by a group of authors from Ho Chi Minh City University of Economics (UEH) was conducted to explore sustainable university models from two aspects of approach and implementation as well as to present their strengths and weaknesses. From this background, a specifically designed model combined with application methods for universities in these countries is to be proposed.**

**Literature review**

Although the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals have been widely applied worldwide, the implementation in developing countries has been facing numerous challenges due to their diverse contexts in each country. A variety of major challenges are posed, listed as poverty, inequality and pollution, all of which require an increase in education and research to promote sustainable development. To be illustrated, Universities – with an important role in training future generations of leaders – need to integrate education on sustainable development at all levels.

Various lessons have been demonsstrated regarding applying the sustainable university model in universities in Eastern and Central Europe: they focus on teaching and research besides emphasizing management, learning and cooperation. Omn the other hand, a unified development strategy cannot be applied to all sustainable universities; therefore, there is a need for separate models and methods appropriate to each country’s context. Therefore, an important research question that continuously attracts university managers is to determine the optimal sustainable university approach, transformation and implementation model suitable for the needs of universities in the context of emerging markets and developing countries. This study aims to identify the most effective strategies with the purpose of ensuring long-term environmental, social and economic sustainability for universities in developing countries.

Up to the present time, different models have been being applied on how to approach and to implement a sustainable university. Among them, 07 popular models include the following: (1) Management-oriented model (Managerial Model), (2) Transitional model (Transitional Model), (3) Community model (Community Model), (4) research-centered model (Research Centric Model), (5) Green university system (Green University System), (6) UNEP Sustainable University Implementation framework (UNEP Framework) and (7) (Sustainable University Excellence). In short, the first five models mainly take a top-down approach and emphasize sustainable integration into the core functions of a university whereas the final two models emphasize both deployment framework.

**Higher education in emerging markets**

The current emerging market landscape is comprised of two main types of universities. First is the high-end public universities that are closely related to the region’s progress. Second is young startup universities that apply a privatized operating structure. Regardless of the university, “Education” and “Research” play an integral, symbolic role recognized by academic and community organizations, ensuring the nurturing of a successful workforce in those emerging economies and developing countries. Therefore, the challenge lies in how these universities can effectively be transformed into a sustainable university model while being emphasizing the core values “Education” and “Research”. Therefore, upon developing the approaches and the models for sustainable university implementation in these emerging economies and developing countries, the following essential characteristics should be carefully considered:    

- This approach must be dependent upon the theory and consistent with practical considerations;

- Emphasizing the transition from a traditional university to a sustainable university;

- Integrating the harmonious sustainable development principles into the basic and extended functions of the university without changing the inherent operational structure of the university;

- Implementing the framework with a long-term vision, allowing for continuous improvement and adapting the most appropriate strategies for each stage of the university’s development.

**Research methods**

The study, following the three-step analytical framework developed by Levy and Ellis, used narrative review, a popular qualitative research method, including the following factors: searching and screening documents, extracting and analyzing data, and writing a literature review. This approach effectively synthesizes a selective body of literature in this special field, providing the detailed information on the relevant topics and issues. 

**Models proposed for sustainable university strategy in the developing countries**

From the research method, the authors have proposed a model that combines approaches and implementation techniques like a system transformation, including the following 05 typical pillars: **Education, Research, Development Campus Sustainability, Community and Governance**. The Governance pillar takes on the driving forces, the Campus Sustainability pillar is a central aspect of the overarching model, acting as o ne key pillar connecting diverse key functions, including Education, Research and Community. Besides, the proposed model tries to overcome the limitations of the “Research-centered” model and the “Community” model by using the **Plan – Do – Check – Act** method. PDCA (Plan – Do – Check – Act) is an implementation principle in the process of planning, organizing, evaluating and implementing plans and initiatives.

To implement this proposed model, universities need to consider implementing the following 03 factors: 

(1) Continuous strategic improvement with PDCA principles; 

(2) Applying of the Living Lab model – a tool to ensure the connection of the 5 pillars of the sustainable university model; 

(3) Building the “Solidarity” culture among individuals, increasing understanding and consensus in implementing the university’s common goals.

Generally speaking, the proposed model emphasizes the importance of sustainability on campus as a convergence point for the remaining four functions: Education, Research, Community and Administration. At the same time, the study supports the integration of training and research focused on sustainability that contributes to achieving the 17 SDGs. Furthermore, the study contributes to enriching the theoretical foundation for implementing a sustainable university and is one of the pioneering studies in exploring the context of emerging and developing countries in the period of conversion period.
