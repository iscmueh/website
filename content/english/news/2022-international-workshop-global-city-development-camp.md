Here, students have the opportunity to explore the Mekong Delta and Vinh Long, a beautiful land hidden behind the values of various internationalist historical and cultural relics.

Opening the program was an orientation session introducing the program, interesting activities, and "challenges" for each taking part team during the event. At the same time, the students joined in a forum-sharing session with a multi-dimensional perspective from the local government, lecturers, and experts on Mang Thit - Kingdom of Bricks.
