In these lectures, experts have directly addressed the complicated relationships among architecture, city, and culture in prominent East Asian countries like Japan and China, as well as Southeast Asian nations like Vietnam. These nations feature urban designs and architectural forms deeply intertwined with traditional values, cultural practices, social norms, and natural environments. This integration reflects a convergence of multi - perspectives, driven by research needs and diverse human experiences and insights.

Within this complex and varied context, **the Ulysses Online course Architecture, City, and Culture in East Asia**, offers participants multiple approaches to understanding these connections. Rather than imposing a single viewpoint, the lectures encourage participants to cultivate their perspectives and skills, fostering a continuous, longitudinal view of architecture and urbanism. This approach provides a basis for interpreting essential concepts and criteria that define certain foundational ideas, developed through the evolution of Urban Architecture. These ideas have had a substantial influence on the present state and significance of architecture, cities, and culture in East Asia.

Representing the Institute of Smart City and Management (ISCM), Dr. Huynh Van Khang (Lecturer, ISCM) delivered a presentation on **Climate Responsiveness in Traditional Vietnamese Architecture**. In his presentation, Khang highlighted the spatial characteristics of traditional Vietnamese architecture and bioclimatic design solutions that align with local climate conditions. He also distilled lessons and insights from traditional architectural practices, applying them to modern designs to carry forward valuable historical knowledge. This approach aims to lay a solid foundation for developing a contemporary Vietnamese architecture that both honors past values and strives toward a sustainable future.
