#### [INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE - SUSTAINABLE UNIVERSITY DEVELOPMENT: OPPORTUNITY AND CHALLENGE (SUDOC) 2022]({{< ref "http://sudoc.info/" >}})

Sustainable development has opened up many opportunities but brought about challenges as well. In this progress, the role of higher education is focal, particularly in connecting all relevant stakeholders. In promoting that, the University of Economics HCMC (UEH), in collaboration with local and international partners, is organizing the international conference “Sustainable University Development: Opportunity and Challenge (SUDOC)” 2022 as a response to the call to act on sustainability, especially in the context of the world’s recovery from the COVID 19 pandemic.

The SUDOC 2022 is a forum to discuss the necessity of sustainable university development, pillars and standards of sustainability in universities, models to execute, as well as solutions to promote the role of higher education in practicing sustainability through its core activities: education, research, operation, community connect, and governance. The conference is believed to provide a platform for sharing, networking, and partnering. You can find helpful information and knowledge at the conference through research findings and the network of participants who share an interest in acting on sustainability. It is also a chance for scientists and local and international experts to discuss and collaborate to successfully implement the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) initiated by the United Nations for a sustainable future in 2030.

Welcome to UEH - Vietnam, and to the international conference SUDOC 2022 toward a sustainable future!
