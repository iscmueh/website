🏙 People-oriented cities developed by and for its residents, promoting collaboration toward sustainability. Each citizen wants a better life for their family. They ponder about a meaningful way of life and hope their children will grow up in a city that improves the global future. They also want for a community where they feel like they belong.

🏙 In this webinar, we will discuss community involvement and the responsibilities of stakeholders and communities, how to engage them, and approaches to improve stakeholder engagement. Through these experiences, we seek to learn what works in the field and how these ideas might be duplicated to develop other great, livable future cities.

🏙 As part of the "A Future Resilience through Smart City Lens" series of events, the webinar titled “Stories of community engagement” organized by ISCM, University of Melbourne, Capire, Greendot Connection Consultancy, Southern Institute of Social Sciences, in collaboration with international partners.
