Time: from 8AM to 6PM - December 17, 2021
Free of charge

This is the first time SmartCity+ 2021 has brought a special exhibition that showcases projects and ideas from Vietnam and over 30 countries around the world. We have incubated, created, tested, and launched products for a smart city and a sustainable future.

Coming to the exhibition, we are pleased to invite you to contemplate the multi-dimensional creations of different authors and designers, ranging from simple ideas to completed concepts, but they have one thing in common, which is research and getting out of the comfort zone, exploring and innovating.

Don't miss this exhibition tomorrow, December 17, 2021, to enjoy the SMARTCITY+ concept.
