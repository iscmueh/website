Time: from 8AM to 6PM - December 17, 2021  
Free of charge

This is the first time that SmartCity+ 2021 has brought a special exhibition to the event, which will include projects and ideas from Vietnam as well as more than 30 other nations. We have incubated, created, tested, and launched products for a smart city and a sustainable future.

Coming to the exhibition, we are delighted to encourage you to take in the multi-dimensional works of art created by a variety of authors and designers. They vary from basic thoughts to fully developed concepts, but they all have one thing in common: they are based on study and the willingness to go outside of one's comfort zone in order to explore and innovate.

Donâ€™t miss this exhibition on December 17, 2021  to enjoy the SMARTCITY+ concept
