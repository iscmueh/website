Join the Brownfield Redevelopment Webinar: Unlocking Urban Sustainability

Are you interested in unlocking the potential of brownfields to revitalize your community, create jobs, and protect the environment? Join us for a webinar on brownfield redevelopment.

Date&Time: 4 PM - 10 May 2023

Venue: Room B1.204, UEH Campus B, 279 Nguyen Tri Phuong Street, District 10, Ho Chi Minh City

Link register: https://forms.gle/muG89vTvyVc4QADT7

Brownfield redevelopment has recently emerged as a strategy fostering urban sustainability in the industrialized world. It has the potential to make use of existing infrastructure, ease the pressure on undeveloped land, promote job creation, increase local tax bases, and enhance and protect the environment. This is a complex process involving a wide range of stakeholders with different interests and viewpoints.

In this webinar, we will discuss the challenges and opportunities of brownfield redevelopment. We will also provide an overview of the resources available to help communities redevelop brownfields.

This webinar is for anyone who is interested in brownfield redevelopment, including local government officials, community development professionals, real estate developers, environmental professionals, investors, and students.

The webinar is hosted by the Institute of Smart City and Management in collaboration with the Department of Architecture and Planning of Ho Chi Minh City, KU Leuven, OMGEVING as a part of our series event 2023: Design for Carbon Neutrality Future.

Space is limited, so register today! We hope to see you there!
