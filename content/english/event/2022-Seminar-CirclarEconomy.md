🌠 University is the key enabler of innovation and circularity. Yet in Vietnam, the role of universities is not fully recognised to truly bolster the momentum for a circularity movement.

🌠 To initiate fruitful partnerships and discussions, our event will bring together local entrepreneurs and funders giving key insights on pathways to foster support and collaboration for a thriving circular entrepreneurial ecosystem among Vietnam's universities.

⏰ Time: Thursday, June 16, 2022, 15:00 - 16:30 (GMT+7)

📍Location: ISCM Studiolab - 232/6 Vo Thi Sau, District 3, Ho Chi Minh City
