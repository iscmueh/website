As part of a series of events to foster collaboration with universities around the world as part of the  2022 - A Future Resilience Through Smart City Lens event series, the Institute of Smart City and Management had a field trip from August 22-30 to experience, discuss cooperation with various smart city research agencies and units as well as universities in Korea, one of the leading countries in smart city development.

As a young institute of the UEH, the ISCM always makes constant efforts to create and develop new goals for developing smart cities in Vietnam. ISCM believes it is great to learn and directly experience Korea's achievements in city modeling and smart urban design, and to absorb the "quintessence of a hundred years" by standing on the shoulders of giants.

During this trip, ISCM worked with partners such as The Incheon Free Economic Zone, the Stanford Living lab in Songdo; Jeju Research Institute, Sangmyeong Wind Power Complex, CFI Future Hall, Northeast Resources Circulation Center, and KEPCO in Jeju Island; Seoul Department of Transportation and Smart City, KTPA, etc. In addition, ISCM also visited and discussed the potential of comprehensive cooperation with universities such as the University of Seoul, Seoul National University, Sungkyunkwan University, and Kangwon University.

The successful excursion and work in Korea paved the way for the next trips in the future, which is a great effort to take UEH-ISCM to the great seas and contribute to the path of becoming a university academic reputation of UEH. At the same time, this journey "on the shoulders of giants" is a firm commitment to ISCM's mission and vision to build a smart and livable city.
