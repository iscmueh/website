RMIT’s Smart & Sustainable Cities Forum’s (SSC) overarching goal is to provide a platform for the sharing of best practices and knowledge to ensure that stakeholders across key industry segments, public sector organizations and local/international NGOs have the information critical for Vietnam’s developing cities. 
Speakers include government leaders, executives from top industry partners (KPMG, UNDP, Schneider Electric, World Bank, etc.), RMIT leaders and executives 
The key themes of this SSC are of significant importance to sustainably develop Vietnam’s urban centres. Based on the 2020 Vietnam census, the current population of Hanoi and HCMC are about 8.3 and 9.3 million respectively, and both cities are expected to grow further. As such, the SSC seeks to inform participants on key aspects to set the development agenda of the cities in the right direction. 

Topics include : 

*   Smart Governance and the link to United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals 
*   BlockChain Innovations 
*   Liveable Cities from The Australian Urban Observatory 
*   Government vision for smart & sustainable development 
*   Benchmarking progress of smart city development 
*   Moving towards a “Digital Vietnam” 
*   Smart tourism, governance, and logistics 
*   Sustainable waste management & plastic pollution 
*   Smart City solutions for Climate Change
 

ISCM is honored to have Dr. Tu Anh Trinh - Director of ISCM participate in this forum as a guest speaker of the event with many other guests.
