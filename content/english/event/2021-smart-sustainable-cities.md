The goal of RMIT's Smart & Sustainable Cities (SSC) Forum is to provide a platform for stakeholders from various industry segments, organizations, regional organizations, and local/international NGOs to share knowledge and best practices in order to ensure that stakeholders from various industry segments, organizations, regional organizations, and local/international NGOs have important information on the direction of developing cities in Vietnam. Government officials, leaders from prominent industry partners (KPMG, UNDP, Schneider Electric, World Bank, and others), and leaders from RMIT University are among the speakers. The key subjects of this event are critical to the long-term growth of Vietnam's metropolitan areas. The present populations of Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City are between 8.3 and 9.3 million people, according to Vietnam in 2020, and are likely to grow even more. As a result, the goal of this forum is to discover a means to enlighten participants about the primary concerns so that appropriate urban development ideas may be offered.

1. *   Smart Governance and the link to United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals
