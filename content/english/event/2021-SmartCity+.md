The year 2021 will be remembered for major changes in different areas, as well as an uncertain future due to Covid-19. The difficulties have compelled us to "regenerate" and give us a chance to "plus." At ISCM, we are continually changing, exploring the "creative zone," and connecting the community with the goal of creating a smart city brand based on cultural values, technology, and available resources in order to achieve long-term sustainability.

SMARTCITY+ Festival, which we have cherished for a long time, will be held. The festival will bring a series of events you should not miss this December. With a variety of activities ranging from the online and offline format, it is flexible to provide many channels of communication for content, such as exhibitions, seminars, and webinars.
