🌈 a year to regenerate
🌈 a year to rethink our city
🌈 a year to sustain our future
🌈 a year to +

2021, marking many changes in all aspects and forecasting an uncertain future ahead. The challenges compelled us to "regenerate" and provided us an opportunity to "+". At ISCM, we always change, explore the "creative zone" and connect the community with an ambition to build a smart city brand from cultural values, technology, and existing resources to achieve sustainable development.

This Friday, SMARTCITY+ Festival, which we have cherished for a long time, will be held. The festival will bring a series of events you should not miss this December. With a variety of activities ranging from the online and offline format, it is flexible to provide many channels of communication for content, such as exhibitions, seminars, and webinars. 

📍 Always free
📍 Time: 8 AM to 8 PM - December 17, 2021
📍 Venue: UEH Campus B, 279 Nguyen Tri Phuong, District 10, HCMC, Vietnam
📍 Online format (coming soon)
