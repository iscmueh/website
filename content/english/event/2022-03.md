RECAP INTERNATIONAL WORKSHOP WEEK: GLOBAL CITY DEVELOPMENT CAMP
Since 2020, the International Workshop has successfully connected and shared knowledge among project members, providing participants with multi-dimensional perspectives that facilitate problem-solving, practical application of knowledge, and unforgettable experiences with international friends.\
On behalf of the organizers and partners to organize the international workshop week with the theme Global City Development Camp 2022, ISCM would like to thank the members, partners, and units who have accompanied during the past program. This year's workshop is over, but that doesn't mean that learning, capacity building, thinking, solidarity, and friendship between nations will cease. Let's work with us to move towards a smart and livable city.
Now, let's look at some of the special moments with ISCM. Once again, thank you, and see you soon!
