As we grow more aware of the significant influence that our clothing has on the environment, the term "sustainable fashion" is becoming more and more popular (and overused). Given the seriousness of the current climate issue, the industry is accountable for between 4% and 10% of the world's annual greenhouse gas emissions. Too few brands now address all of these difficulties because of the myriad aspects involved, even those that admit there is always space for improvement. We need to fundamentally rethink our buying patterns and the way we consume clothing, which means it's not enough to simply purchase items labeled "sustainable."
In the A Future Resilience through Smart-City Lens 2022 Event Series, ISCM in collaboration with many experts from organizers, universities,... would like to invite you to a workshop titled Sustainable Fashion. In this workshop, you will gain insights from our experts and also learn more about the future resilience.
