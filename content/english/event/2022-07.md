ISCM (UEH-CTD) has partnered with @Circular Cities Asia to bring the Circular Campus Programme to our university this September!

As part of the programme, students and alumni will have the chance to join an open innovation competition. Prizes include an innovation boot camp run by ClimateLaunchpad trainer Shiva Susarla and incubation opportunities with the RENERGii startup venture studio (which includes $2000 USD of seed funding)!

*Please note: You are welcome to register as individuals to participate and learn from the programme toolkit, workshops and webinars, even if you do not intend to join a team for the competition.
