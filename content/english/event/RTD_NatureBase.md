Designing Architecture and Urban Areas with Minimal Impact on Natural Landscapes?

Although Vietnam is indeed a country with a potentially rich green - green network, urban planning and architectural designs have not yet fully utilized and promoted this network to successfully create a smart city with landscapes capable of high resilient rate in the face of global changes.

To address this issue, Nature-Based Solutions (NBS) are proposed as an effective approach to protect, conserve, restore, sustainably use, and manage natural or modified ecosystems on land, freshwater areas, coastal regions, and underwater environments. By leveraging natural elements and processes, this solution offers urban and architectural designs that effectively address and adapt to social, economic, and environmental challenges, providing benefits for people, ecosystem services, resilience, and biodiversity.

At the RTD 2024 International Conference, we will discuss this special solution and propose application directions for the urban context of Vietnam. This discussion will take place in a special session with the theme "Nature-Based Solutions for Smart Urban Development"!

In this special discussion, RTD 2024 is honored to welcome a distinguished panel of speakers from Italy, Belgium, Macao, and Vietnam

🎤 Chair:
 Professor Elena Marchigiani - University of Trieste, Italy
