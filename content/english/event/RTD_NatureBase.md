While Vietnam boasts promising green - blue connections , urban planning, design, and architecture have yet to fully leverage and enhance this network to successfully create a smart city with landscapes capable of high resilience in the face of global changes.

At the RTD 2024 International Conference, we will discuss Nature-based Solutions (NBS) as a potential approach to the aforementioned issue. This discussion will take place in a special session titled "Nature-based Solutions for Smart Urban Development," featuring experts from Vietnam, Belgium, and Macao.

During the session, experts will propose ways to utilize natural elements and processes. These solutions aim to provide urban design and architectural approaches that effectively address and adapt to social, economic, and environmental challenges, while also benefiting humans, ecosystem services, resilience, and biodiversity. These proposals will be conveyed through exemplary cases from around the world, with a particular focus on Vietnam.
