On January 16, the ISCM team and students were honoured to represent UEH University to attend the Porsche Saigon experience in Ho Chi Minh City.
We had the opportunity to experience the streamlined architecture with the human-centered design combined with a strong sporty style. Moreover, with our commitment to a sustainable future, we also have the opportunity to know information about Porsche's electric car.
