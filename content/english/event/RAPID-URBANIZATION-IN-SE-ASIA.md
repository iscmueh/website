Asia is home to more than half of the world's urban residents. Asia and the Pacific have the most people living in cities (51% of the population), which makes them at risk of unchecked urban growth. Every year, more than 40 million people, or 100,000 people every day, move to towns. Urbanization is happening quickly at all levels, which leads to uncontrolled growth, unofficial towns and ways of doing business, bad infrastructure, traffic jams, the effects of climate change, and environmental damage in Asian cities. 

The Institute of Smart City and Management, in collaboration with Thammasat University to organize a lecture about Asia, presented by Dr. Adrian Yat Wai Lo from Thammasat University (Thailand). This lecture especially talks about Southeast Asian countries like Thailand and Vietnam, which are becoming more urbanized. It also looks for ways to solve today's pressing problems so that cities will be better in the future.
