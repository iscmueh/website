The CSL @ HCMC aims to use a data-driven platform, namely CityScope, which was developed by Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) to simulate and study the urban development in Ho Chi Minh City. The establishment of the lab is the result of the cooperation between Architecture Research Center - Ho Chi Minh City Department of Planning and Architecture, Media Lab - Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), Multimedia Communications Laboratory (MMLab) - University of Information Technology, Vlab Joint Stock Company, Sunny World Development & Management Corporation (SDMC), and Institute of Smart Cities and Management - University of Economics Ho Chi Minh City (ISCM-UEH).

The CityScope is a platform using physical models in combination with algorithm, visualization technology and urban data to develop the models in which users can interact and change items to demonstrate the economic, social and physical interactions winthin the city in different scenarios. This emerging technology solution has been applied in the world’s big cities.

At the ceremony, Prof. Dr. Su Dinh Thanh cut the ribbon and sent his best wishes to the partners, hoping that the experience and knowledge gained from this project will be successfully applied to the urban planning management for Ho Chi Minh City in the future.
