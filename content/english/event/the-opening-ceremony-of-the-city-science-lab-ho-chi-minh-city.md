In the morning of April 22, 2021, the opening ceremony of the City Science Lab @ Ho Chi Minh City (CSL @ HCMC) was successfully celebrated at 422 Vo Van Kiet Street, Co Giang ward, District 1.

The event was attended by distinguished guests, including Mr. Le Hoa Binh, Vice Chairman of the HCMC People’s Committee, and other representatives from the local authorities and universities. The representatives from UEH consisted of Prof. Dr. Su Dinh Thanh, UEH President, and Dr. T Anh Trinh, Director of the Institute of Smart City and Management (ISCM).

The CSL @ HCMC aims to use a data-driven platform, namely CityScope, which was developed by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), to simulate and study the urban development in Ho Chi Minh City. The establishment of the lab is the result of the cooperation between the Architecture Research Center and the Ho Chi Minh City Department of Planning and Architecture, Media Lab-Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), Multimedia Communications Laboratory (MMLab)-University of Information Technology, Vlab Joint Stock Company, Sunny World Development & Management Corporation (SDMC), and the Institute of Smart Cities and Management-University of Economics Ho Chi Minh City (ISCM-UEH).

The CityScope is a platform using physical models in combination with algorithms, visualization technology, and urban data to develop models in which users can interact and change items to demonstrate the economic, social, and physical interactions within the city in different scenarios. This emerging technology solution has been applied in the world’s big cities.

At the ceremony, Prof. Dr. Su Dinh Thanh cut the ribbon and sent his best wishes to the partners, hoping that the experience and knowledge gained from this project will be successfully applied to the urban planning management for Ho Chi Minh City in the future.
