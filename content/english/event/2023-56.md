üßë‚ÄçüíªOn October 20, 2023, the Institute of Smart City and Management held a Workshop: Computer Vision in Mobility Analysis with the participation of students from different majors. Directly referring to the application of technology, especially AI technology in the field of smart mobility, the workshop brought new information on the application of Computer Vision technology to break the limits of scale, as well as technical requirements of traditional observation methods.

üõµThroughout the workshop, the participants directly experienced two traffic analysis methods used in research: the traditional observation method and the method of applying computer vision technology.  Thereby, participants intuitively felt the differences, especially the efficiency in using Computer Vision technology.  At the same time, when combined with the theory of how Computer Vision algorithms work, they had a deep understanding and knowledge of how to apply Computer Vision in the field of transportation, as well as in many other fields.
