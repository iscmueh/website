Following urbanization, many urban problems happened. Climate change has negatively affected the whole world, and VietNam is one of the countries that has been greatly influenced by that negative climate phenomenon. In order to take action on those problems, Carbon Neutrality has become a popular solution.

With the topic Reimagining Cities Towards Carbon Neutrality, the 3rd International Design Competition is our hope to promote and call for stakeholders to participate in contributing ideas, and solutions integrated with design architecture, technology,... along with the logical studies on local culture, globalization, adaptability and visions of future environment towards positive carbon changes in a larger scale.
