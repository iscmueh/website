INTERNATIONAL SUMMER COURSE URBAN BEYOND THE URBAN IN NHA TRANG: INTEGRATE MULTI-PERSPECTIVE TO DELVE INTO NIGHT ECONOMY

Be tourist, experience fascinating activities of Nha Trang - the coastal city,

Be local, discover Nha Trang in many angles,

And be researcher, together develop practical suggestions for resilient tourism and in further vision, sustainable economy.

In the last July, the Institute of Smart Cities and Management - University of Economics Ho Chi Minh city (UEH-ISCM), in collaboration with Handong Global University (Korea) and Thammasat University (Thailand), successfully organized the annual International Summer Course “Urban Beyond the Urban” in Nha Trang. The event is a part of ISCM 2023 events series: Design for Carbon Neutrality Future.

With the main theme of Night Economy, the summer course has attracted many Vietnamese and International students, who study in many fields. Together, they participated in many activities, confidently unleashed their creativity, boldness, and “think global, act local”.

Especially, by experience in different roles, the students could combine the two local and tourist perspectives in the research, thereby coming up with excellent topics for proposals for the night economy development. These are all science-based solutions, tailored to local needs, help to improve lives, effectively attract tourists and contribute to sustainable development.

Let’s look back at momentous experiences during the International Summer Course (UBU): Night Economy that were captured by the students and team.
