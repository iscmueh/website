ü§ùIn today's evolving urban landscape, the role of community engagement is more critical than ever in shaping transportation projects that are inclusive, sustainable, and aligned with the needs of diverse populations. Community engagement encompasses not just collaboration but a commitment to integrating community perspectives at every stage, resulting in projects that reflect local needs and priorities.

üöãFor the 21st century transport initiatives, success goes beyond infrastructure development which research and output also address broader societal concerns, from improving quality of life and public safety to ensuring access for all. It covered topics beyond infrastructure development, road safety behavior enhancement through education & training and gender equality in access to public facilities. Community engagement therefore enhances the purpose of transport projects, ensuring they provide appropriate, practical and impactful solutions that meet today's urban challenges.

‚úàÔ∏èHighlighting the role of community engagement in smart transportation research, the Institute of Smart City and Management (ISCM) at the University of Economics Ho Chi Minh City, in collaboration with Thammasat University, Suranaree University of Technology (Thailand), and Chittagong University (Bangladesh), is organizing the Webinar ‚ÄúEmpowering Urban Mobility: The Role of Community Engagement in 21st Century Transportation Projects.‚Äù  

With insights from experts across Asia, participants will gain a practical perspective on integrating community feedback throughout the research process. This understanding forms the foundation for implementing impactful and positive projects that benefit communities, not only in the field of transportation but also in all areas related to smart and sustainable urban development.
