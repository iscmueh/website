üåüAs part of the Summer Conference for the Southeast Asia Region organized by the American Institute of Architects, the present titled ‚ÄúMerging Tradition and Innovation Through Passive Design in Tropical Climate‚Äù will be delivered by Dr. Hu·ª≥nh VƒÉn Khang, Lecturer at the Institute of Smart City  and Management, University of Economics Ho Chi Minh City.

Directly targeting Sustainable Architecture, Dr. Hu·ª≥nh VƒÉn Khang‚Äôs presentation emphasizes solutions that address climate challenges while harmonizing with existing cultural contexts, particularly those in Southern Vietnam. These solutions encapsulate the essence of traditional residential design principles, innovatively combined with passive design strategies such as ventilation, solar radiation control, and natural lighting. This represents a distinctive fusion of tradition and modernity, merging values to produce a framework for sustainable architectural solutions.
