For over a month, the ISCM team accompanied and followed our students as they took their first subjects, marveling at their hidden creativity and clear progress with each lesson. Through every class and every practice, we recognized the firmness tempered by sweat, effort and the rhythmic coordination of knowledge about the spatial thinking and geometry of all students.

The entry of K48 is also the time for us to "open up" a new space. From the modern multipurpose studio at Campus V (232/6 Vo Thi Sau) to the new modern classrooms (Studiolab 1 and 2) at Campus B (279 Nguyen Tri Phuong).

All are equipped with modern facilities and international standards, aiming to provide learners with the best learning environment and experience. This will allow students to unleash their creativity and realize their ideas.
Now, let’s look back at us our students’ experiences!
