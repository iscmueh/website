Bringing the entire city, including buildings, infrastructure, transportation systems, power grids, and even residents into digital space, the Digital Twin has been applied in smart cities worldwide. This model is continuously updated with city data from sensors and IoT devices around the cities. Consequently, this technology supports experts in fields such as management, architectural design, urban design and planning by continuously updating urban conditions, simulating various urban development scenarios, and providing numerous other utilities.

Referring to the Digital Twin in Smart City development, the special discussion session "Digital Twin and Smart City" will take place on July 16, 2024, as part of the 2nd International Scientific Conference Resilience by Technology and Design (RTD 2024). With the participation of experts from both domestic and international contexts, the discussion session will propose approaches to using this technology in existing smart cities worldwide, thereby drawing lessons and application methods for the development of Vietnamese cities.
