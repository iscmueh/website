One of the indispensable activities of the students of Architecture and Urban Design Inclusive Smart City, in the past few days, the Exhibition of Batch 48 ISCM students has officially returned with completely new works from two subjects: Basic Studiolab 3, and History of Architecture and Urbanism .

Displayed pieces of art are conducted from the process of field survey, document research on history, structure, infrastructure, living environment and various other perspectives on the area in the past few months. Along with the results achieved after this analysis and synthesis process, Batch 48 of ISCM has understood more about how to evaluate the factors affecting an urban area, cases of historical urban areas, and then apply them to the process of identifying problems and proposing appropriate planning solutions in the future work process.
