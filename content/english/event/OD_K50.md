After much anticipation, the Institute of Smart City and Management at the University of Economics Ho Chi Minh City (UEH) is officially opening registration for the Welcome Night: Beyond Limit, Beyond Dream, 
The welcome night is a part of the Orientation Day 2024, organized by ISCM. As the annual traditional event of the Architectural and Urban Design inclusive Smart City Program, the event proudly serves as a space where new students meet and connect with previous generations of the institutes and students. Each year, it marks the beginning of a meaningful journey for the freshmen as they embark on their path of "Shaping the Unknown Future." This year, the Orientation Day will share the story of a bold journey, encouraging students to face challenges and pursue their dreams.

Aligned with this vision, the Welcome Night will ignite passion among K50, of the Architectural and Urban Design inclusive Smart City Program in particular, and all K50 members of the UEH family in general.
