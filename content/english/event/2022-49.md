In order to improve geometric spatial thinking, make spatial proportions in architecture a habit, and apply them to the reality of the upcoming Christmas and New Year events, the Institute of Smart City and Management (ISCM) is working with partners CASAtelier and N.A.N studio collaborate for a workshop on Fibonacci boxes. The program is part of a series of events in 2022 - "Future Resilience Through a Smart City Lens", hosted by ISCM.
