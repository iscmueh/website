_On April 12, 2024, as part of the City Project subjects, officials from Khanh Hoa province, enrolled in the Master's program in Smart City and Innovation Management, conducted a field trip to various exemplary projects and campuses of the University of Economics Ho Chi Minh City (UEH) throughout Ho Chi Minh City._

Affirming the pioneering role in better education, fostering potential, and building a foundation for learners to approach multidimensional perspectives, the Institute of Smart City and Management - University of Economics Ho Chi Minh City (UEH-ISCM) facilitated opportunities for students in the Master's program to learn and engage in discussions with local authorities in developing urban areas, particularly smart cities worldwide. Following a trip to Bangkok, Thailand, the students continued their visits in Ho Chi Minh City.
