To find an equitable answer to the true questions of sustainable urban mobility in the 21st century, the Consulate General of the Kingdom of the Netherlands in HCMC together with University of Economics Ho Chi Minh City (UEH) organize the ThinkBike Sustainable Development Workshop, with the participation of international experts from Dutch Cycling Embassy, â€‹â€‹Humankind, Royal HaskoningDHV and UEH College of Technology and Design (CTD). At ThinkBike Workshop, you will have a precious opportunity to hear from prestigious experts about sustainable urban transport and be a big part of spreading the message of benefits of cycling in the context of urban limited space.

ThinkBike Sustainable Development Workshop does not impose Dutch solutions onto communities but help them to learn from Dutch experience, so that we could come up with solutions to promote cycling in HCMC based on its local geographical, political and cultural realities.
