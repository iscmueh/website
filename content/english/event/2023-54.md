üèÅExquisite architecture combined with a strong sports car spirit;

üåêThe first center in the Asia-Pacific region to fully adopt the latest Destination Porsche architectural concept, setting new standards in design, construction, maintenance, and operations for future Porsche centers in the region;

üå±The first project in Vietnam automobile industry to receive LEED Gold (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) certification for green building, aiming for a future of sustainable  development;

On October 2, students of the Bachelor of Architectural and Urban Design inclusive Smart City program had the opportunity to visit the Porsche Centre Saigon located in District 7, Ho Chi Minh City. The trip helped the students have not only an overview, but also a detailed view of the showroom's architectural designs and special arrangements.

Right during the trip, the Porsche Centre Saigon attracted the attention of the students with a space full of natural light created by cleverly arranged glass panels in the building's architecture. In addition, the emergence of environmentally friendly electric vehicles, high-performance AC and DC charging stations for hybrid (PHEVs) and pure electric vehicles (BEVs), together with other factors have contributed to Porsche's commitment to a green and sustainable future.

Experience and understanding the architectural concept and core value of the business, after the trip, ISCM students can apply not only to their upcoming project products, but also in their future work process. This is one of ISCM's training goals, aiming to help students be ready and sharp to take advantage of potential job opportunities not only domestically, but also around Southeast Asia.
