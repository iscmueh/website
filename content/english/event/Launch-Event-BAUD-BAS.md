<!--StartFragment-->

On September 3, 2021, the Institute of Smart City and Management of the University of Economics Ho Chi Minh City and the Faculty of Creative Arts and Industries of the University of Auckland successfully held the launch of the Bachelor of Architecture and Urban Design (BAUD) and Bachelor of Architectural Studies (BAS) dual-degree program. This is an opportunity to achieve 2 university degrees in a short time, and learn more about the ideal educational environment, opportunities to study, work and settle in New Zealand for students.

This cooperation marked a step forward in the journey to reach the international level of the University of Economics Ho Chi Minh City (UEH).
