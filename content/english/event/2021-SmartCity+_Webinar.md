When urbanization occurs, we often encounter the choice of equity or efficiency for city development. More specifically, what is a "fair" city for all or what is an efficient and sustainable city? Not only that, in the context of the epidemic, COVID-19 has revealed issues in times of pandemic, so what is the best choice for us?

To address this question, ISCM, UII (UEH-CTD), Handong Global University, University of Milan, the University of Auckland, Survival Skills Vietnam-SSVN, Hasselt University, and World Smart Cities Forum (WSCF), in collaboration with our international partners, would like to invite you to our webinar. The webinar is part of the SMARTCITY+ Festival 2021.
