⭐In 2024, the world’s largest sporting event, the Paris Olympics, selected Saint Ouen as the residence for participating athletes, also known as the Olympic Village. This has turned the city of Saint Ouen into a case study, enabling research and experience-sharing through the data collected from residents' feedback, ultimately leading to the formulation of suitable development strategies.

🏸The Institute of Smart City and Management (University of Economics Ho Chi Minh City), in collaboration with Audencia Business School (France), is organizing a workshop and designathon: Digital Cities Challenges. This designathon provides an opportunity to access the latest data from local insights gathered in Saint Ouen. Not only will students get a multi-disciplinary perspective to develop strategies based on existing data, but they will also learn and practice using interactive software to create images and videos. Through these tools, they will enhance the persuasiveness of their proposed strategies by employing the most creative and effective storytelling methods.
