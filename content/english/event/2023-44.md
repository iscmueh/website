Nowadays, the Circular economy (CE) has been widely adopted by different business sizes and types, including SMEs. It is believed that with their small and medium-sized structure, they are flexible in adapting to technological and environmental changes in their operations, thus promoting the transition to a circular model. However, it also comes with restrictions on adopting sustainable models, such as financial obstacles, human resources, and state policy.

This seminar explores how SMEs apply CE in their business and promote circular production/operation processes. The main topics include:

Innovation in CE practices
The current state of CE practices around the world
Practical experience shared by SMEs.
