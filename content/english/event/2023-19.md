With rapid urban growth, shifts in productivity, and a rush toward modernization, there is a risk of homogenizing territories and settlement systems. The conference will address issues such as deforestation, hardscapes, road developments, sprawl, and export processing zones, which intensify the consequences of global warming.

Co-organized by the International Center of Urbanisms: Settlements & Environments (ICoU), Department of Architecture, KU Leuven University; the University of Architecture HCMC (UAH), and the Institute of Smart City & Management, College of Technology and Design (UEH-CTD/ISCM), this conference will critically examine the challenges and opportunities of contemporary Southeast Asian urbanism.

The conference will focus on the evolving notion of â€˜landscape urbanismâ€™ through three sub-categories: water urbanism, forest urbanism, and urban countryside/rural metropolis. These sub-categories will provide a framework for discussing how Southeast Asian cities and settlements can develop in a sustainable and resilient manner.

Date: 8AM - May 29&30, 2023
