abstract: Quality of working life has been recently observed as a degree of employee satisfaction and job satisfaction. Hence, many organizational policies have been formulated to effortfully upgrade job performance which leads to not only job satisfaction but also employee satisfaction. However, the question is that whether there is other factors impact on quality of working life that the organizations have neglected. The study was conducted to identify the factors of quality of working life in the case of front-line staff in the Vietnamese aviation sector. The study focused on 212 aviation employees who came from many various airports in Vietnam. The Cronbachâ€™s alpha of each construct was found to be greater than 0.81. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was applied to examine the internal reliability of measurements and structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to test the goodness of the proposed model. The findings of the study supported eight hypotheses which indicated that perceived organization supports (POS), emotion exhaustion (EE), extra-role services (ES), and servicescape (SE) affected on quality of working life (QWL) of aviation employees. Moreover, this research discovered that intrinsic motivation (IM) played as a mediating factor that affected negatively on EE and positively on ES. The implication of the study suggested that the more POS employees recognized with the caring, approvals policies, the closer level the employees and managers incorporated, and POS was a key factor to enhance the employee performances which was referred by extra-role services, emotional exhaustion, and quality of working life. As a fast-growing industry in our contemporary society, the Vietnamese aviation sector priorly needed to tackle the issue of aviation working service environment which implied as servicescape in this study to upgrade the quality of employee working life and toward the quality of Vietnamese aviation service.
