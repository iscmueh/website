This project aims to deploy sustainable waste management to the University of Economics Ho Chi Minh City (UEH). UEH has cooperated with the Vietnam Zero Waste Alliance (VZWA) to promote a zero-waste lifestyle and build zero-waste campuses by focusing on separating at source and reducing the use of single-use plastic products. ISCM-UEH is developing an integrated education platform that fosters knowledge, skills, and Reduce â€“ Reuse -Recycle (3Rs) behaviors.
