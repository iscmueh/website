Cities compete among others in the context of globalization. ISCM-UEH is working to make a marketing plan for Ho Chi Minh City that focuses on safe zones for kids.  
The project aims to propose a framework of city branding adapted for city planning to deal with current issues. The issues include typical urban problems, consistency values to engage different stakeholders,  competitive capability, and urban identity.
