#### About Course:

Technology is one of the crucial drivers driving the development and success of smart cities. However, not all cities have the ability to develop and fully apply technologies, and at the same time balance investment resources in technology with investment in other areas to improve the quality of urban life. This course provides learners with background knowledge about emerging technologies that are making significant contributions to the development of smart cities, their advantages and disadvantages, and solutions for applying this technology in the context of cities in the world and Vietnam. At the end of the course, learners will learn about different technologies and methods of analyzing, comparing, and choosing the best technology solutions to solve urban problems.
