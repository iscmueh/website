  content : "At ISCM, Smart City is not about the destination, it is about a lifelong journey. From our perspective, cities are considered organisms full of ceaseless activities. In these activities, urban problems may emerge. To effectively solve these problems, we must prioritize them, allocate our limited assets, and apply technology to create smart solutions. Smart is not only about applying advanced technology, but it also integrates all efficient resources as sustainable as possible. Within our Smart City, decisions are human-centric, and the unity of universities, organizations, government,  stakeholders, and communities create a co-creative culture. This, hereby, leads this organism to be more lively, a place for all people, leaving no one behind.


  We are shaping the unknown future by our main fields of Smart Planning, Smart Design, Smart Management, Smart Transportation, and Integrated Application. We warmly welcome you to join our extensive network, be inspired, and inspire the world by our innovation, ambition, and creativity. 




  Dr. Tú Anh Trịnh - Director of Institute of Smart City and Management "
